# My guitars
This tribute page is about my guitars. I like them a lot and play them a lot. I got my first guitar as a gift from a friend, who got himself a better guitar so he 
gave me this one. This sparked my interest on the instrument. I joined classes and learned to play a lot. Seeing my dedication my dad decided to buy me an electric
guitar which is one of the best things ever. As a kid i could only dream of playing an electric guitar and how cool they looked when actual professionals played it.
I play my guitars everyday without fail.
They give me peace, solace they give me the chance to forget everything for a moment and just float away to music land :)
Another thing is I don't want to learn all the pro techniques and give shows and do all that. I just want to play songs that I like and be happy with myself.
there have been many occasions where i felt really bad and down but playing something on my guitar instantly lit me up.
I absolutely reccomend you to pick an instrument, any of your choice and try to learn it. It can be no, will be hard at first but the satisfaction you get after 
mastering playing the one song you love, is nothing short of bliss..
